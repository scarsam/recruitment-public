# Coding Assignment 

## Summary

Create a web site that retrieves the current weather for a location provided by the user.

As data source you can use the openweathermap API. You can use this API token `a17480f70f0d4368ad0b5eabd0e37b66` for authentication or register your own.

Example query:
```
curl "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Stockholm&appid=a17480f70f0d4368ad0b5eabd0e37b66"
```

## Requirements
- Show the current temprature in _Celcius_ for the location that the user provides
- Add an icon to the page according which represents the weather at the location (Feel free to use a frame such as [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) as example)

## Prerequisites

- A skeleton written in React is provided, but you don't need to use any of it
- You should be able to explain and discuss your solution at the interview

## Tips

- Use at most 2 hours for the assignment. We don't need perfect code. We just want to have something we can discuss.
- Have fun and `yarn start`!
